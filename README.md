# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be a combination of physics and software curriculums. The project will be a simulation of a rocket launching off of an earth-like planet, with the same radius and mass, but with no atmosphere.

## Sub-goals

* Accurately calculates the velocity, acceleration, and position vectors of a rocket, as it takes off
* Displays that data graphically, over time.
