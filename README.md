# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be a combination of physics and software curriculums. The project will be a simulation of a rocket launching off of an earth-like planet, with the same radius and mass, but with no atmosphere.

## Sub-goals

* Accurately calculates the velocity, acceleration, and position vectors of a rocket, as it takes off
* Displays that data graphically, over time.

# Installing
## Mac
* In terminal run this command:
* `pip install rosshill-physics`
* If that doesn't work, make sure Python is installed by running `python -v` in terminal.
* If Python is not installed, download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/

# Usage
## Mac
* In terminal, enter: `physics`
