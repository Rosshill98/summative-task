# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be a combination of physics and software curriculums. The project will be a simulation of a rocket launching off of an earth-like planet, with the same radius and mass, but with no atmosphere.

## Sub-goals

* Accurately calculates the velocity, acceleration, and position vectors of a rocket, as it takes off
* Displays that data graphically, over time.

# Installing
## Mac
* In terminal run this command:
* `pip install rosshill-physics`
* If that doesn't work, make sure Python is installed by running `python -v` in terminal.
* If Python is not installed, download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/

# Usage
## Mac
* In terminal, enter: `physics`

# Reflection
## What (if anything â€“ although there is probably at least something) does the user need to know about what your program does?
## What (if anything) does the user need to know to operate your program (keystrokes, et cetera)?
## How does your program show evidence of your understanding of object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation and inheritance?
## What evidence can you provide that your program is human-readable?

### For example, where have you used: descriptive function names, meaningful variable names, comments that describe the intention of a block of code

### What is the most important algorithm, or algorithm(s), in your program? That is, where is the "core idea" of your program? Explain how this works.

### How have you made your program easy to use?
### How have you made correct use of source control?

    For example, show that you have:
        made frequent commits
        kept commits "atomic" (i.e.: one accomplishment per commit, rather than a batch of things all committed at once)
        descriptive commit message
